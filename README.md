<h2><ins>School-Management-System in Asp.Net C# using Database</ins></h2>

<h3>🔷Overview🔷</h3>
<p> Our Management System is developed for the Schools to ensure all academic processes 
or management in an organized manners. The basic objective of this system is to facilitate the 
administrative and students. The system created to solve the problems and to provide a 
standardized means for the students.</p> 
<h3>🔷Problems Statement/Disadvantages of not using Management Systems🔷</h3>
<p>The current problem in high school in Pakistan is that the management didn’t have systematic 
data arrangement.</p>
<ul>
<li> Lack Of Data Arrangement that is record by using manual system (paper, registers, etc.) 
to record the students information, result and performance. </li>
<li>The manual system is difficult to search or maintain properly about the students 
information.</li>
<li>Some information released by the school is not known by the parents or teachers.
(notices, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<h3>🔷Objective🔷</h3>
<p>The objectives of this system are</p>
<li>To record all the student academic information for future reference and enhancement 
and to update/search student record including personal information, result, 
performance, etc.</li>
<li>To record all the Employee information for future reference and enhancement and to 
update/search employee record including personal information, performance, etc.</li>
<li>To notify through SMS,MAIL to parents, students and teachers about the occurring 
meeting or activity.</li>
<h3>🔷System Process🔷</h3>
<p>In this project, we apply waterfall model.</p><br>
<p>This system process include these phases are</p>
<li>Requirements analysis System and software design</li>
<li>Implementation and unit testing </li>
<li>Integration and system testing </li>
<li>Operation and maintenance</li>
<p>In Waterfall Model, each phase has to be complete in order to start next phase.</p> 
<h3>🔷Architecture Pattern🔷</h3>
<p>In this project, we are using 3-Tier Architecture Pattern.</p><br> 
<p>This pattern consist of 3 layers</p>
<ul>
<li> Presentation Layer</li>
  The presentation layer is front end layer in three tier system and consist of user 
interface. This user interface is often a graphical one accessible through a web-based app to display the content.
<li> Application Layer</li>
  The Application layer contains the functional business logic which drives an 
applications core capabilities. It’s often written in C#, Python, JavaScript, C++ etc.
<li> Data Layer</li>
  The data layer comprises of the databases/data storage system and data access 
layer using database query languages. Data is accessed by the application layer 
via API calls. 
</ul>
<h3>🔷Development Environment🔷</h3>
</p>The Tech we use here in <b>Presentation layer</b> means for User Interface are <b>Html</b> and <b>CSS</b>
and Styling Framework Like(<b>Bootstrap</b>, <b>Tailwind CSS</b>, etc.) and for <b>Business logic</b> and Server 
side validations we used <b>C#</b> and <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>php</b> validations varies on the requirements. In 
<b>Data Access layer</b> using <b>MySQL</b> to manipulate the data from database</p>
