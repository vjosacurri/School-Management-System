<h3>ðŸ”·OverviewðŸ”·</h3>

or management in an organized manners. The basic objective of this system is to facilitate the 
administrative and students. The system created to solve the problems and to provide a 
standardized means for the students.</p> 
<h3>ðŸ”·Problems Statement/Disadvantages of not using Management SystemsðŸ”·</h3>
<p>The current problem in high school in Pakistan is that the management didnâ€™t have systematic 
data arrangement.</p>
<ul>
<li> Lack Of Data Arrangement that is record by using manual system (paper, registers, etc.) 
to record the students information, result and performance. </li>
<li>The manual system is difficult to search or maintain properly about the students 
information.</li>
<li>Some information released by the school is not known by the parents or teachers.
(notices, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<h3>ðŸ”·ObjectiveðŸ”·</h3>
<p>The objectives of this system are</p>

update/search employee record including personal information, performance, etc.</li>
<li>To notify through SMS,MAIL to parents, students and teachers about the occurring

<h3>ðŸ”·System ProcessðŸ”·</h3>
<p>In this project, we apply waterfall model.</p><br>
<p>This system process include these phases are</p>
<li>Requirements analysisï‚· System and software design</li>
<li>Implementation and unit testing </li>
<li>Integration and system testing </li>
<li>Operation and maintenance</li>
<p>In Waterfall Model, each phase has to be complete in order to start next phase.</p> 
<h3>ðŸ”·Architecture PatternðŸ”·</h3>
<p>In this project, we are using 3-Tier Architecture Pattern.</p><br> 
<p>This pattern consist of 3 layers</p>
<ul>
<li> Presentation Layer</li>
  The presentation layer is front end layer in three tier system and consist of user 
interface. This user interface is often a graphical one accessible through a web-based app to display the content.
<li> Application Layer</li>
  The Application layer contains the functional business logic which drives an 
applications core capabilities. Itâ€™s often written in C#, Python, JavaScript, C++ etc.
<li> Data Layer</li>
  The data layer comprises of the databases/data storage system and data access 
layer using database query languages. Data is accessed by the application layer 
via API calls. 
</ul>
<h3>ðŸ”·Development EnvironmentðŸ”·</h3>
</p>The Tech we use here in <b>Presentation layer</b> means for User Interface are <b>Html</b> and <b>CSS</b>
and Styling Framework Like(<b>Bootstrap</b>, <b>Tailwind CSS</b>, etc.) and for <b>Business logic</b> and Server 
side validations we used <b>C#</b> and <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>php</b> validations varies on the requirements. In 
<b>Data Access layer</b> using <b>MySQL</b> to manipulate the data from database</p>
